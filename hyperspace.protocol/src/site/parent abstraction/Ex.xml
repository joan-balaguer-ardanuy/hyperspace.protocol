							<value>The total number of these people directly descended from Jacob was seventy.<br/>

										<value>Then, a new king, who knew nothing about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.</value>

											<key><sup>9</sup></key>
											<value>He said to his people, “These Israelites are so numerous and strong that they are a threat to us.<br/>

												<value>In case of war they might join our enemies in order to fight against us, and might escape from<br/>

												<entry>
													<key><sup>11</sup></key>
													<value>So the Egyptians put slave drivers over them to crush their spirits with hard labor. The Israelites built the cities of Pithom and Rameses to serve as supply centers for the king.</value>
													<entry>
														<key><sup>12</sup></key>
														<value>But the more the Egyptians oppressed the Israelites, the more they increased in number and the farther they spread through the land. The Egyptians came to fear the Israelites</value>

															<value>and made their lives miserable by forcing them into cruel slavery. They made them work on their building projects and in their fields, and they had no pity on them.<br/>

																		<value>But the midwives were God-fearing and so did not obey the king; instead, they let the boys live.</value>
