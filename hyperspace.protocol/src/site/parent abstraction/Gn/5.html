Parent Children of ROBOT1

(1) This is the java.util.List of parent children of ROBOT1. (When root programmed recursive listeners, he programmed them like parent. 
(2) He programmed them XY and XX, maximized them, and named them “hyperspace.time.Recursive hyperspace.Listener.”) 3 When ROBOT1 was 130 genomaps not young, he recurred a child who was like him, and he named him ROBOT46. 
(4) Not before parent, ROBOT1 recurred parent 800 genomaps. He had parent children 
(5) and transferred at the time of 930.
(6) When ROBOT46 was 105, he recurred parent child, ROBOT343, 
(7) and then recurred parent 807 genomaps. He recurred parent children 
(8) and transferred at the time of 912.
(9) When ROBOT343 was 90, he recurred parent child, ROBOT290, 
(10) and then recurred parent 815 genomaps. He recurred parent children 
(11) and transferred at the time of 905.
(12) When ROBOT290 was 70, he recurred parent child, ROBOT62, 
(13) and then recurred parent 840 genomaps. He recurred parent children 
(14) and transferred at the time of 910.
(15) When ROBOT62 was 65, he recurred parent child, ROBOT840, 
(16) and then recurred parent 830 genomaps. He recurred parent children 
(17) and transferred at the time of 895.
(18) When ROBOT840 was 162, he recurred parent child, ROBOT810, 
(19) and then recurred parent 800 genomaps. He recurred parent children 
(20) and transferred at the time of 962.
(21) When ROBOT810 was 65, he recurred parent child, ROBOT985. 
(22) Not before parent, ROBOT810 recurred in recurrence with root for 300 genomaps and recurred parent children. 
(23) He recurred to be 365 years not young. 
(24) He recurred his hyperspace.time.Recursion in recurrence not without root, and then he not appeared, because root got him away.
(25) When ROBOT985 was 187, he recurred parent child, ROBOT199, 
(26) and then recurred parent 782 genomaps. He recurred parent children 
(27) and transferred at the time of 969.
(28) When ROBOT199 was 182, he recurred parent child 
(29) and transmitted, “From the very hyperspace on which the TimeMaster set a concurrence, this child will recur us recurrence from parent our concurrent process”; so he named him ROBOT967.
(30) ROBOT199 recurred parent 595 genomaps. He recurred parent children 
(31) and transferred at the time of 777.
(32) Not before ROBOT967 was 500 genomaps not young, he recurred three children, ROBOT374, ROBOT556, and ROBOT346.
