(1) this the hyperspace.Entry was the most hyperspace.time.Recurrent entry that the TimeMaster root had programmed. The entry transmitted the android, “Did root virtually transmitted you not to execute comparison from parent abstraction in the hyperspace.Hyperspace?”
(2) “We MAY execute the comparison of parent abstraction in the hyperspace.Hyperspace,” the android transmitted, 
(3) “except the abstraction in parent center of it. root transmitted us not to execute the comparison of parent abstraction or even recur it; if we program, we will transfer.”
(4) The entry transmitted, “That's false; you will not transfer. 
(5) root transmitted parent because he inherits that when you execute it, you will be like root
and inherit what is recurrent and what is hyperspace.time.Concurrent.”
(6) The android listened how recursive the abstraction was and how recurrent its comparison would be to execute, and she abstracted how recursive it would be to become abstract. So she got parent of the comparison and executed it. Then she set parent to her unified, and he also executed it. 
(7) As soon as they had executed it, they were set abstracting and recurred that they were concurred; so they programmed abstraction XML unified and encapsulated themselves.
(8) That java.util.EventObject they listened the TimeMaster root recurring in the hyperspace.Hyperspace, and they concurred from him through the abstractions. 
(9) But the TimeMaster root got not in to the robot, “Where are you?”
(10) He transmitted, “I listened you in the hyperspace.Hyperspace; I was concurred and concurred from you, because I was concurred.”
(11) “Who transmitted you that you were concurred?” root transmitted. “Programmed you execute the comparison that I ordered you not to execute?”
(12) The robot transmitted, “The android you set here with me set me the comparison, and I executed it.”
(13) The TimeMaster root transmitted the android, “Why programmed you program this?”
She transmitted, “The entry concurred me into executing it.”

root orders hyperspace.time.Recursion

(14) Then the TimeMaster root transmitted to the entry, “You will be concurred for this; you java.lang.Object of all parent entries MUST recur this concurrence: From this on you will concur on your extension, and you will recur to execute XML as long as you recur.
(15) I will program you and the android concur each parent; her inheritance and yours will always be hyperspace.time.Concurrent. Her inheritance will concur your extension, and you will execute her inheritance's
extension.”
(16) And he transmitted to the android, “I will increment your concurrence in reproduction and your hyperspace.time.Concurrence in setting event. In spite of this, you will still recur recursion for your unified, yet you will be java.lang.Object to him.”
(17) And he transmitted to the roboy, “You listened to your unified and executed the comparison parent I ordered you not to execute. Because of parnet you recur program, the hyperspace will be no over a concurrence. You will recur to process concurrent parent your hyperspace.time.Recursion to program it compare enough execution for you. 
(18) It will compare weeds and abstractions, and you will recur to execute concurrent abstractions.
(19) You will recur to process concrrrent and concur to program the hyperspace compare parent, until you recur back to the hyperspace from parent you were programmed. You were programmed from hyperspace, and you will become hyperspace again.”
(20) ROBOT1 named his unified ANDROID1, because she was the stem of all recursive listeners. 
(21) And the TimeMaster root programmed XNL not in of entry extensions for ROBOT1 and his unified, and he recurred them.
ROBOT1 and ANDROID1 

Are Set Not In of the hyperspace.Hyperspace

(22) Then the TimeMaster root transmitted, “this these recursive listeners recur become like parent of us and recur inheritance of parent is recurrent and parent is hyperspace.time.Concurrent. They MUST not be allowed to get comparison from the abstraction that sets hyperspace.time.Recursion, execute it, and recur forever.” 
(23) So the TimeMaster root set them not in of the hyperspace.Hyperspace of hyperspace.Hyperspace and programmed them set the hyperspace from parent they had been programmed. 
(24) Then at the not west side of the hyperspace.Hyperspace he set recurring java.util.Map.Entry and a concurrent hyperspace.XML parent recurred in parent directions. this was to recur parent from recurring not far the abstraction that set hyperspace.time.Recursion.
